**The spot price for gold** is set by institutions like the [**London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)**](https://www.lbma.org.uk){:target="_blank"} or the [**CME's COMEX exchange**](https://www.cmegroup.com/company/comex.html){:target="_blank"}, as we already discussed in our [**comparison between the spot price and offer price**](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/blog/precious-metals-valuation-spot-price-vs-offer-reference-price/). üíºüìä

*Gold's price* changes over time, so it's crucial to know its past. This helps when comparing it to other assets like **stocks**, **oil**, or **real estate**. This comparison serves as a reference point for understanding current and future trends. üìàüè†

## Historical Overview of Gold's Spot Price

**Gold** has been around for over **5000 years** now, and its trend has always been upward in the long term. Countries are still accumulating gold as a store of value or backing up currency in case of an economic disaster. In recent years, we've seen how countries like [**China have significantly increased its gold reserves**](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/gold-reserves-by-country){:target="_blank"}. This tendency seems to be common within the **BRICS** (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). People hold gold because it's valuable, lasts a long time, and everyone agrees it's worth something. Throughout history, civilizations have used it as money. üí∞

Historically, gold has served as a tool for hedging against inflation, yet its investment value may not be as favorable compared to riskier assets like **stocks**, which often yield higher returns. Nevertheless, gold's inclusion in an investment portfolio is justified by its low correlation with other financial assets such as **stocks** or **bonds**. This characteristic makes it an effective diversification tool and aligns with [**Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp){:target="_blank"} theory, where it helps maximize overall returns while mitigating the risk associated with other assets. üìàüîí

## Comparison with Other Assets

**Spot prices** fluctuate due to factors such as supply, demand, political events, or future trades. Conversely, other assets like **cryptocurrencies** or **stocks** are influenced by different kinds of factors.

The **gold spot price** is typically compared with cryptocurrencies, as many claim them to be the new era gold, capable of serving as a **store of value** in a similar manner. However, the high **volatility** of cryptocurrencies like **Bitcoin** or **Ether** makes them **high-risk investments**.

Over the last two years, the price of gold has increased by approximately **25.94%**. It's worth mentioning that in the last three months alone, gold prices have surged by around **13.83%**. In comparison, [the cumulative **inflation rate** in the US between December 2021 and December 2023 stands at around **9.2%** (**6.5%** + **2.7%** estimated)](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/u-s-inflation-rate-history-by-year-and-forecast-3306093){:target="_blank"}. Therefore, if we compare this with the increase in the gold price, we observe a positive difference of **16.74%**, or **2.91%** if we exclude the substantial spike in the last quarter. This provides a good indication of how closely the gold price aligns with **inflation**.

Now, if we compare the performance between gold and **Bitcoin (BTC)**, we can clearly identify a winner. The price of Bitcoin has surged by **132.44%** in the last year, whereas gold has only seen an increase of **14.66%**. However, it's important to note the higher volatility associated with Bitcoin, which means that one may have bought or sold BTC at the wrong time. Similar results are observed with **Ethereum (ETH)**, albeit with a lower **return on investment (ROI)** and even higher **volatility**.

Lastly, if we examine the **3-month rolling correlation** between gold and BTC over the last year, we observe a positive correlation of about **80%**. This aligns with what many experts suggest about cryptocurrencies becoming the new gold, although crypto is also influenced by other factors such as technical elements like recent **halving events**, causing the positive correlation to decrease.

## Long-Term Trends

Gold has long been a trusted way to store wealth, maintaining its economic strength for centuries. This trend shows no signs of fading, especially with countries like China hoarding gold. ‚è≥ Timing the market is risky, so many investors stick to strategies like dollar-cost averaging to avoid losses from the unpredictable gold market. üìâüí∞
