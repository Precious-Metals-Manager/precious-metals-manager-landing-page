## Introduction

â€˜Junk Silverâ€™ primarily denotes circulated coins with silver content used as legal tender currency, mostly in the United States. It is also known as â€˜Old US Silverâ€™ or â€˜scrap Silver.â€™ Junk Silver holds historical and economic significance because silver coins represent actual money. In the event of an economic collapse, their purchasing power would likely endure.

Among the most popular junk silver coins are the Morgan Dollar and the Barber Dime, both containing 90% silver. They possess face values of $1 and 10Â¢ (one-tenth of a United States dollar) and were minted from 1878 to 1921 and from 1892 to 1916, respectively.

## Understanding the Concept of Junk Silver

The term 'junk' typically refers to silver coins that lack significant collectible value. Most commonly, these are highly circulated silver coins pre-dating 1965 with a 90% silver content and noticeable wear. However, some exceptions to the pre-1965 90% silver coins are the 35% silver War Nickels minted between 1942 and 1946 or the 40% Silver Kennedy Half-Dollars minted between 1965 and 1970.

Junk silver is primarily a term used in the US because these coins are abundant and typically sold based on weight or face value. In contrast, what constitutes 'junk' silver in the US isn't necessarily viewed the same way in places like Europe. Specifically, coins like Morgans and other older pieces are highly sought after by collectors there, asking for significant premiums due to their scarcity. For instance, in Europe, examples of 'junk' silver might include the 50 Francs 90% silver coin minted between 1974 and 1980, the 2 Reichsmark .625 silver coin minted from 1924 to 1948, or the West-German 5 Deutsche Mark .625 silver coin minted between 1951 and 1974. Unfortunately, even local 'junk' silver in non-US regions often carries high premiums as they're seen as collectibles.

## Factors Influencing Junk Silver Value

While certain US junk silver coins may fetch high premiums due to rarity or exceptional condition, the majority tend to have lower premiums. Therefore, we will refer to junk silver as those coins with no collectible or numismatic value.

The value of junk silver is based on the silver content, which is tipically 90% in the US, with exceptions like the the 35% silver War Nickels or the 40% Silver Kennedy Half-Dollars. The purity is apply when calculating the junk silver value. In case of War Nickels a wear coeficient is not applied.

In case of pre-1965 90% silver coins we also have to factor the wear and tear from circulation.

## Calculating Junk Silver Value

The calculation for non-pre-1965 90% silver coins is straightforward as wear and tear are not typically factored in. The formula would be:

```
value = purity * silver spot price * silver coin weight in troy oz * units
```

Alternatively, considering that $1 face value of War nickels contains approximately 1.125 troy oz of silver:

```
value = 1.125 troy oz * silver spot price
```

For example, if we aim to purchase $1 face value of circulated War Nickels at a silver melt value of $24.48:

```
0.35 purity * $24.48/troy oz * 0.1608 troy oz * 20 units = ~$27.55
```

or:

```
1.125 troy oz * $24.48/troy oz = ~$27.55
```

You'll notice that while the face value is only $1, the intrinsic value is $27.55 due to its silver content. These junk silver coins might occasionally turn up in change, potentially yielding a profit of 2655%. However, such finds are increasingly rare.

On the other hand, a wear coefficient is applied to pre-1965 90% silver coins:

```
value = purity * silver spot price * silver coin weight in troy oz * units * (1 - 0.011612)
```

Typically, this coefficient is represented as $1 face value of junk Silver containing approximately 0.715 troy oz of silver, or the $1 face value price for junk at spot, dividing spot by 1.4:

```
value = $X face value * silver spot price * 0.715
```

or:

```
value = $X face value * silver spot price / 1.4
```

For instance, let's consider the purchase of $10 face value of 90% Barber Quarters:

```
0.9 * 24.48/troy oz * 0.2009 * 40 * (1 - 0.011612) = ~$175
```

or:

```
10 * 24.48/troy oz * 0.715 = ~$175
```

```
10 * 24.48/troy oz / 1.4 = ~$175
```

Please note that the previous formulas do not include the dealer premium, which should be taken into account.

## Market Factors and Valuation

Many of the US junk silver coins are becoming increasingly difficult to find as time passes. Consequently, their premiums are gradually rising since they hold historical significance, attracting collectors. This trend is currently noticeable in Europe, where silver legal tender currency hold very high premiums.

## Conclusion

Junk silver might be difficult to value specially because not all 'junk silver' is really 'junk' silver, like coins key dates, or older types that are driven by numismatic value.

Silver stacker usually use well known formulas for calculating junk silver value, like $1.40 face value in 90% silver is a troy ounce of silver.
