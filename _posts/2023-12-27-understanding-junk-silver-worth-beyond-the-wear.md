üîç **Junk Silver** refers to old coins circulated as legal currency in the United States, containing **silver**. Also called **‚ÄòOld US Silver‚Äô** or **‚Äòscrap Silver,‚Äô** these coins are historically and economically important because they represent real money. If there were an economic collapse, their value would likely remain stable.

Popular examples of **junk silver** coins include the **Morgan Dollar** and the **Barber Dime**, both made of **90% silver**. They have face values of **$1** and **10 cents**, respectively, and were minted from **1878** to **1921** and from **1892** to **1916**.

## Understanding the Concept of Junk Silver

**'Junk'** silver usually refers to **silver coins** that aren't very collectible. These are typically heavily used **coins made before 1965 with 90%** silver and visible wear. However, there are exceptions like the ***35% silver War Nickels*** from **1942** to **1946** or the ***40% Silver Kennedy Half-Dollars*** from **1965** to **1970**.

In the US, **junk** silver is a common term because these coins are plentiful and often sold by weight or face value. But what's considered **'junk'** silver in the US might not be seen the same way in Europe. There, coins like ***Morgans*** and other older pieces are highly desired by collectors and can sell for much more. For example, **'junk'** silver in Europe might include coins like the ***50 Francs 90%*** silver coin from **1974** to **1980**, the ***2 Reichsmark .625*** silver coin from **1924** to **1948**, or the ***West-German 5 Deutsche Mark .625*** silver coin from **1951** to **1974**. Unfortunately, even **'junk'** silver in non-US areas often has high prices because they're considered collectibles. üåçüí∞

## Acquiring Junk Silver

You can acquire junk silver coins from dealers like [APMEX](https://www.apmex.com/category/25800/junk-silver-coins-35-40-90-silver){:target="_blank"} üõí. Junk silver is usually sold by its face value in rolls or bags üí∞, or individually, especially when they hold numismatic value.

Common packages üì¶ include **$10 face value junk silver** or **$1 face value junk silver** rolls, containing either quarters or half dollars, made of **90% silver**. In the case of bulk purchase, a **$500 face value junk silver** bag, or even a **$1000 face value bag of silver**, are also possible.

## Factors Influencing Junk Silver Value

Most US *junk silver* coins might have low premiums, except for rare or well-preserved ones. So, we consider *junk silver* as coins with no collector's value.

The value of *junk silver* coins is based on the silver content, which is typically **90%** in the US, with exceptions like the the ***35% silver War Nickels*** or the ***40% Silver Kennedy Half-Dollars***. The purity is apply when calculating the *junk silver* value. In case of War Nickels a wear coeficient is not applied.

For pre-1965 **90%** silver coins, we also consider wear and tear from circulation. üîÑ

## How much is junk silver worth?

The calculation for non-pre-1965 **90%** silver coins is straightforward as wear and tear are not typically factored in. The formula would be:

```
value = purity * silver spot price * silver coin weight in troy oz * units
```

Alternatively, if you consider that $1 face value of War nickels contains about 1.125 troy ounces of silver:

```
value = 1.125 troy oz * silver spot price
```

For example, if we aim to purchase $1 face value of circulated War Nickels at a silver melt value of $24.48:

```
0.35 purity * $24.48/troy oz * 0.1608 troy oz * 20 units = ~$27.55
```

or:

```
1.125 troy oz * $24.48/troy oz = ~$27.55
```

You'll notice that while the face value is only $1, the intrinsic value is $27.55 due to its silver content. These *junk silver* coins might occasionally turn up in change, potentially yielding a profit of 2655%. However, such finds are increasingly rare.

On the other hand, a wear coefficient is applied to pre-1965 **90%** silver coins:

```
value = purity * silver spot price * silver coin weight in troy oz * units * (1 - 0.011612)
```

Typically, this coefficient is represented as $1 face value of *junk Silver* containing approximately 0.715 troy oz of silver, or the $1 face value price for junk at spot, dividing spot by 1.4:

```
value = $X face value * silver spot price * 0.715
```

or:

```
value = $X face value * silver spot price / 1.4
```

For instance, let's consider the purchase of $10 face value of ***90% Barber Quarters***:

```
0.9 * 24.48/troy oz * 0.2009 * 40 * (1 - 0.011612) = ~$175
```

or:

```
10 * 24.48/troy oz * 0.715 = ~$175
```

```
10 * 24.48/troy oz / 1.4 = ~$175
```

Please note that the previous formulas do not include the dealer premium, which should be taken into account.

## Market Factors and Valuation

As time goes on, it's getting harder to find many US *junk silver* coins. This means their prices are going up slowly because they're historically important and collectors want them. This trend is especially noticeable in Europe, where silver coins with legal value have very high prices. üìà

## Conclusion

**Valuing junk silver** can be tricky because not all of it is actually "junk." Some coins, like key dates or older types, have numismatic value.

Silver stackers often use simple formulas to calculate *junk silver* value. For example, $1.40 face value in **90% silver** equals one troy ounce of silver.
