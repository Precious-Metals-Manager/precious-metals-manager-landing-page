## Introduction

Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is a strategy used in various investments, like stocks or crypto. It involves investing a set amount at regular times, which helps lower risk, especially in assets with volatile prices.

## Precious Metals & DCA: A Powerful Combination

DCA is useful for beginners and those who avoid risks, even when buying precious metals like gold, silver, or platinum. Instead of buying at one price, you invest a set amount regularly, regardless of the current market price. This way, you don't have to worry about timing the market.

### Setting Up DCA

Applying DCA to precious metals works in the same way as applying this strategy to any other asset. You can simply set a monthly budget and buy gold, silver, or any other metal over a particular period of time.

### Choosing Metals

Using DCA might differ based on the metal you pick. For silver, it's usually simpler because an ounce costs less compared to gold or platinum. Gold, on the other hand, is pricier, so you might think about buying smaller amounts or fractions.

## Challenges & Considerations

### Market Volatility

The results of DCA are usually more noticeable in assets with greater fluctuations. In the case of precious metals, silver has historically been more volatile; therefore, DCA is often a good fit for silver.

### Side effects: Premium & Shipping

When using DCA for precious metals, remember there could be extra costs like higher premiums or shipping fees. If you're buying expensive metals like gold, where one ounce can cost over $2000, you might buy smaller amounts or smaller bars to fit your budget. But keep in mind, these often come with higher premiums. So, it's important to consider this when planning your strategy.

Also, whether you're close to a local coin shop or not, there's usually a shipping or handling fee when you buy precious metals. Even if the shop is nearby, the time you spend going there adds an indirect cost. If you're buying monthly, these recurring shipping costs might cancel out the benefits of using DCA.

To reduce these costs, you might consider adjusting how often you buy. Waiting longer between purchases could lower the overall premium and shipping costs.

### DCA and Gold Silver Ratio

DCA pairs well with the Gold-Silver Ratio strategy. This method involves dividing the price of one ounce of gold by the price of one ounce of silver. When the ratio is higher, it means silver is cheaper, and vice versa. The idea is to regularly buy either silver or gold, depending on which metal is cheaper at the moment.
