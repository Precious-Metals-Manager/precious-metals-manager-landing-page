# Strategic Stacking with Dollar-Cost Averaging in Precious Metals

## Introduction

Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is applied in many types of investments, such as buying stocks or crypto. DCA is a financial strategy that consists of investing a consistent amount at regular intervals. As a result, it reduces the amount of risk, especially in those assets with prices that experience significant fluctuations.

## Precious Metals & DCA: A Powerful Combination

DCA can also be applied to precious metals, making it a powerful tool, especially for beginners and risk-averse individuals. Dollar-cost averaging is effective when acquiring precious metals like gold, silver, or platinum. Instead of purchasing these metals at a single price point, this strategy involves regularly buying a fixed amount at consistent intervals, regardless of the current market's gold spot price, for instance. By adopting this approach, it eliminates the need to time the market.

### Setting Up DCA

Applying DCA to precious metals works in the same way as applying this strategy to any other asset. You can simply set a monthly budget and buy gold, silver, or any other metal over a particular period of time.

### Choosing Metals

The application of DCA might vary depending on the metal you choose. In the case of silver, the application is usually simpler since the cost of an ounce of silver is relatively cheaper compared to other metals like gold or platinum. Conversely, an ounce of gold is expensive, and you might consider buying fractional or smaller bars.

## Challenges & Considerations

### Market Volatility

The results of DCA are usually more noticeable in assets with greater fluctuations. In the case of precious metals, silver has historically been more volatile; therefore, DCA is often a good fit for silver.

### Side effects: Premium & Shipping

One consideration with DCA in precious metals involves potential additional expenses, such as higher premiums or shipping costs. When purchasing high-value metals like gold, where a single troy ounce may exceed $2000 (as of the time of writing this article), budget constraints might lead to acquiring fractional amounts or smaller bars, typically incurring higher premiums. Thus, it's crucial to factor this into your strategy.

Moreover, regardless of proximity to a local coin shop, there's usually a shipping or handling fee associated with acquiring precious metals. Even if the shop is nearby, the time spent visiting adds an indirect cost. In a monthly purchasing scenario, recurring shipping expenses might counteract the advantages of DCA.

To mitigate these costs, adjusting the purchase interval could be beneficial. Increasing the interval might help in reducing the accumulated premium and shipping cost ratio.

### DCA and Gold Silver Ratio

DCA is compatible with the Gold-Silver Ratio strategy, a method that involves dividing the price of one troy ounce of gold by the price of one troy ounce of silver. The resulting ratio indicates cheaper silver when it's higher and vice versa. The concept revolves around periodically buying either silver or gold, depending on which metal is comparatively cheaper at the time.
