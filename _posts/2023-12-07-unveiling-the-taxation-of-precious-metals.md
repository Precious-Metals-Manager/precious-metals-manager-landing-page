Sales tax or VAT (Value-added tax) is sometimes applied to precious metals when purchasing from a registered dealer, such as APMEX or StoneX Bullion. Depending on the country, the type of metal, or the fineness of the metal, a different tax percentage might be applied to the markup price (spot price + [premium](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/blog/understanding-precious-metals-premium/)).

## United States

In the case of the US, sales tax varies in each state. The following figures represent the state-wide rate and reflect the minimum you can expect to pay as of today, December 7th, 2023. Therefore, they do not include any county-specific tax rates.

## Europe

In the European Union, instead of sales tax, it is named VAT (Value-added tax). Countries in the European Union always apply VAT to silver, which can range from 19% to 25%. However, there are countries in Europe, like Switzerland, where the VAT on silver is 7.7%, and in Norway, coins are VAT exempt. Norway is also part of the EEA, making it easier to move goods to the European Union. However, delivering silver to your country within the EU could still be subject to tax upon receiving it. In the UK, which is not part of the European Union anymore, the VAT is 20% on silver.

Fortunately, in the European Union and the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gold-acquisitions-imports-investments-and-vat-notice-70121#sect2){:target="_blank"} or Switzerland, investment-grade gold bullion is exempt from VAT as it is considered an investment asset.

## Australia

As of January 2022, in Australia, investment-grade gold and silver bullion, meeting specific purity requirements, are [exempt from Goods and Services Tax (GST)](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/gst-excise-and-indirect-taxes/gst/when-to-charge-gst-and-when-not-to/gst-free-sales){:target="_blank"}, as outlined in the [Goods and Services Tax Ruling GSTR 2003/10](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/pdf/pbr/gstr2003-010.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Precious metals meeting the following purity criteria are considered exempt:

- gold (in an investment form) of at least 99.5% fineness
- silver (in an investment form) of at least 99.9% fineness
- platinum (in an investment form) of at least 99% fineness

## Canada

In Canada, most precious metals are exempt from GST (Goods and Services Tax), HST (Harmonized Sales Tax), and PST (Provincial Sales Tax) when they are in the form of a bar, ingot, coin, or wafer and possess a purity level of 0.995 for Gold and Platinum, and 0.999 for silver, as outlined in [GST/HST memorandum 17.1](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/17-1/definition-financial-instrument.html){:target="_blank"}. Any other gold, silver, or platinum not meeting these criteria is taxable at either 7% or 15%.
