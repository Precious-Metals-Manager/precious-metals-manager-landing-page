**Sales tax** or VAT (Value-added tax) is sometimes applied to *precious metals* when purchasing from a registered dealer, such as APMEX or StoneX Bullion. Depending on the country, the type of metal, or the fineness of the metal, a different tax percentage might be applied to the markup price (**spot price** + [**premium**](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/blog/understanding-precious-metals-premium/)). 📊✨💰

## Europe

🇪🇺 **In the European Union**, instead of sales tax, it is named VAT (Value-added tax). Countries in the European Union always apply VAT to *silver*, which can range from 19% to 25%. However, there are countries in Europe, like Switzerland, where the VAT on silver is 7.7%, and in Norway, coins are VAT exempt. Norway is also part of the EEA, making it easier to move goods to the European Union. However, delivering silver to your country within the EU could still be subject to tax upon receiving it. In the UK, which is not part of the European Union anymore, the VAT is 20% on silver.

Fortunately, in the European Union and the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gold-acquisitions-imports-investments-and-vat-notice-70121#sect2){:target="_blank"} or Switzerland, investment-grade gold bullion is exempt from VAT as it is considered an investment asset.
