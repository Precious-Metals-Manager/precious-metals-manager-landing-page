# Navigating Capital Gains Taxes on Precious Metals

Certain goverment bodies, such as the IRS, classify physical gold, silver, or platinum in any form as assets for capital taxation purposes, making them subject to capital gains tax. 

In most countries, the capital gain tax is only owed after the sale is made. The capital gain or loss is calculated by subtracting the sale price from the acquisition cost. When it comes to gifts or inheritances, the calculation of capital gain is based on the market value.




You pay Capital gains Tax at your marginal rate (in other words it's added on to your income) on any profits you make. If you hold the asset for longer than a year you get a 50% deduction on the net gain (profit after expenses) you made.

Say you have a job that pays you $70 000/annum. You sell bullion at a net gain of $10 000 within 12 months of its purchase. Your total taxable income will be $80 000 for the year. And you will have a total tax liability of around $17 500.

Say you have a job that pays you $70 000/annum. You sell bullion at a net gain of $10 000 which you held for at least 12 months so you get a 50% discount on the net income earned for that asset ie taxable income is now $5 000 instead of $10 000. Your total taxable income will now be $75 000 for the year instead of $80 000. And you will have a total tax liability of around $16 000.
