When buying precious metals, it's important to consider what's known as the 'Premium,' which is essentially the amount you pay above the metal content at the current spot price. When selling you could get back some of the premium you paid but it won't be as much premium as you originally paid.

The premium is typically presented as a percentage of the base cost and covers expenses like manufacturing, logistics, marketing, dealer profits, taxes, storage, or transaction fees. Consequently, the kind of bullion or the item's size becomes significant. For instance, the premium per ounce on a 1000-ounce bar will likely be lower compared to that of a 100-ounce bar. Bar premiums tend to be lower than those for coins or rounds since coins are generally easier to authenticate without requiring specialized tools. Moreover, bars are typically seen as less liquid compared to coins or rounds due to the need for them to be 'assayed' or authenticated by dealers, which incurs additional costs and time.

Many countries produce their own gold and silver coins. For instance, Canada mints the Maple Leaf, South Africa produces the Krugerrand, and the US issues the American Eagle. These coins typically come with higher premiums due to their ease of authentication and lower risk of counterfeiting, which in turn raises manufacturing costs.

At the time of writing this article, the gold premium can drop as low as 2-3% for a 1 troy ounce coin, while the silver premium typically remains in the 20-25% range for 1 troy ounce coins. Therefore, investing in silver is usually a more long-term investment, as it can take a considerable amount of time for the price of silver to surpass the initially paid price inclusive of the premium.

## Track Premium in the Precious Metals Manager App

In the Precious Metals Manager iOS app, you can track the amount of premium you are paying on every purchase, and everything is calculated for you automatically. Simply input the unit price you paid for a particular item and enable the 'Historical Spot Price' toggle. In a split second, the premium ratio is calculated and displayed below. Now, it's up to you to judge if it was a good deal. Alternatively, you can input the spot price that you wish.
