**Investors** often use ***precious metals*** like 💰🪙 ***gold***, ***silver***, ***platinum***, or ***palladium*** to protect against inflation. Unlike money or stocks, which can be influenced by market feelings, these metals have their own worth. Plus, it's hard for institutions to control their supply because mining capacity is limited globally. 🌍🛠️

## Spot Prices and Their Role

The ***Spot Price*** is what markets usually use to value precious metals compared to regular money. Different institutions and exchanges, like the [London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)](https://www.lbma.org.uk){:target="_blank"} or the [CME's COMEX exchange](https://www.cmegroup.com/company/comex.html){:target="_blank"}, affect the price of precious metals.

***Spot prices*** are handy for comparing the prices of precious metals to other things like cryptocurrencies, regular money, oil, houses, or the stock market. This helps you see how they're doing over time and decide if you want to buy them.

***Spot prices*** change because of things like supply, demand, political events, or future trades. While they give you a quick idea of the least your portfolio is worth, they're not exact for selling because they only show the value of the metal itself and don't include things like taxes or extra charges.

You can also use the ***spot price*** to figure out your overall worth, which might have [tax effects](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/blog/navigating-capital-gains-taxes-on-precious-metals/) depending on where you live. 📊🏠🛢️📉

## Offer/Reference Prices Explained

***Offer*** or reference prices are what 💰💼 ***precious metals vendors*** or dealers show in their shops, and they change based on the live spot price of each metal. These prices are important for estimating how much your precious metals are worth because they include the [premium](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/blog/understanding-precious-metals-premium/) and taxes. They give a better idea of how much you can sell your whole portfolio for, especially if you're selling to other people.

***Dealer offer*** prices and spot prices usually vary the most for ***silver*** and small pieces of metal, as they have a higher price compared to the premium. Selling 1 troy oz of silver at its melt value isn't usually a good idea, especially in places where [VAT or sales tax](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/blog/unveiling-the-taxation-of-precious-metals/) is added to silver. On the other hand, non-small gold bars usually have a smaller premium, so the spot and offer prices might be closer.

Still, the ***offer price*** usually shows a more accurate value of your portfolio, as that's what people pay when they buy from a coin shop. 💵🏢📈

## Calculating Portfolio Value using Both Prices

To value your portfolio using ***spot prices***, visit a reliable website like [Kitco](https://www.kitco.com){:target="_blank"} and multiply the total weight of 💰📊 ***gold, silver, platinum, or palladium*** in troy ounces by their live spot prices. But it's not so simple because factors like weight, purity, or wear affect the total metal content.

Likewise, you can calculate the value based on markup prices from your dealer. However, it's tricky to track the quantity in ounces or grams for each metal. This gets even more complicated when dealing with different types of bullion, including fractionals or "[junk metal](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/blog/value-of-junk-silver-coins/)".

The solution is to use a tool that tracks your portfolio accurately. 🛠️📈

## Tool for Tracking Valuation: Precious Metals Manager App

📱 The ***Precious Metals Manager app*** lets you easily track your 💰 precious metals portfolio wherever you are. With just a few taps, you can log your bullion and get a clear picture of your portfolio's total value. The app also breaks down the value of each metal, whether you're using ***spot prices*** or ***offer prices***.

The ***spot price valuation*** is shown in two ways: at the ***annual report level***, where you can compare gains or losses year by year based on the market value of precious metals, and at the ***order level***. At the order level, you can see the current value of a specific order and how its value has changed since you bought it.

Also, the app displays the ***reference price*** for popular bullion coins, which reflects the average price over the last 24 hours. You can see these prices for items in your inventory and for coins listed in the 'Bullion Catalog' section. 📈🔍
