## Introduction

Precious metals are often used as a hedge against inflation, with many investors allocating a portion of their portfolio to physical gold, silver, platinum, or palladium. These metals serve as a hedge due to their intrinsic value, unlike printed money or stocks, whose prices are influenced by market sentiment, speculation, and external factors. Moreover, the supply of precious metals such as gold and silver cannot be easily manipulated by institutions due to technical limitations on global mining capacity.

## Spot Prices and Their Role

The Spot Price is typically what markets use to value precious metals against fiat. Several institutions and exchanges, such as the [London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)](https://www.lbma.org.uk){:target="_blank"} or the [CME's COMEX exchange](https://www.cmegroup.com/company/comex.html){:target="_blank"}, influence the price of precious metals.

The spot price serves as a valuable tool for comparing the price of precious metals against other assets like cryptocurrencies, fiat, oil, housing, or the stock market. This comparison allows you to assess their performance over time and make informed decisions when considering purchasing precious metals.

Spot prices fluctuate based on supply, demand, political events, or future exchanges. While these prices provide a quick overview of your portfolio's minimum value, they are not a precise estimation for selling, as the spot price represents the melt value and does not account for taxes or the premium.

The spot price can also be used to calculate your net worth, which might have [taxation implications](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/blog/navigating-capital-gains-taxes-on-precious-metals/) depending on your country.

## Offer/Reference Prices Explained

Offer or reference prices are the prices displayed by precious metals vendors or dealers in their shops, and they fluctuate based on the live spot price of each metal. These prices are crucial for estimating the value of your precious metals portfolio as they include the [premium](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/blog/understanding-precious-metals-premium/) and taxes. They provide a better approximation of how much your entire portfolio can be sold for, especially when selling to other individuals.

Dealer offer prices and spot prices tend to differ the most for silver and fractional metals, given their higher price-to-premium ratio. Selling 1 troy oz of silver at the silver melt value is generally not advisable, especially in regions where [VAT or sales tax](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/blog/unveiling-the-taxation-of-precious-metals/) is applied to silver. Conversely, non-fractional gold bullion usually carries a smaller premium, leading to potential alignment between spot and offer prices.

Regardless, the offer price typically offers a better representation of your portfolio's value, as that's the price people are charged when buying from a coin shop.

## Calculating Portfolio Value using Both Prices

For a spot price portfolio valuation, you can obtain the price from a trusted website like [Kitco](https://www.kitco.com){:target="_blank"} and multiply the total content of gold, silver, platinum, or palladium in troy ounces within your portfolio by the corresponding live spot price. However, this process isn't as straightforward as it may seem since factors such as weight, purity, or wear due to circulation will determine the total metal content.

Similarly, you can use the markup prices displayed by your preferred dealer to calculate the value based on the offer price. The challenge, once again, lies in keeping track of the quantity in ounces or grams for each metal. Calculating your portfolio value based on the offer price becomes even more complex when considering the need to average offer prices from different types of bullion, including fractionals or ["junk metal"](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/blog/understanding-junk-silver-worth-beyond-the-wear/).

The solution to these highlighted problems is to use a tool that enables precise portfolio tracking.

## Tool for Tracking Valuation: Precious Metals Manager App

The Precious Metals Manager app allows you to track your entire precious metals portfolio on the go and log your bullion with a few taps. The app provides a comprehensive overview of your entire portfolio's total valuation, offering a more detailed valuation of each metal and each order. Both spot price-based and offer price-based valuations are available.

The spot price valuation is displayed at both the annual report level, enabling year-by-year comparison of gains or losses based on the precious metals market melt value, and at the order level. At the order level, you can view the current value of a specific order and its value evolution since the purchase date.

Additionally, the app shows the reference price for some of the most popular bullion coins, based on the average price in the last 24 hours. These prices are visible for the items logged in your inventory and within the coins listed in the 'Bullion Catalog' section.

## Conclusion

The spot price and offer price are valuable for tracking your precious metals portfolio valuation and calculating your precious metals net worth, especially when managing tax obligations or considering the sale of part or the entire portfolio.
