5) In case of modification, the input screen for updating an existing bullion consists of:

* Name
* Mint
* Purity (aka fineness): it represents the karat as a ratio.
* Wear: percentage of loss due to circulation. It's commonly used for junk silver.
* Metal Content: weight exluding alloy in troy ounces or grams.
