The concept of "Bullion" in Precious Metals Manager represents either a coin, bar or round.

1) Tap on the Catalog tab.

2) Select metal (Gold, Silver, Patinum, or Palladium) and form factor (Coin, Bar, or Round).

3) Tap on the "+" button to open up the page to create a bullion preset.

   data_dark="/assets/images/dark/catalog_dark.webp"
   alt="Catalog screen" %}

Alternatively, you can create a bullion preset while [creating an item](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/help/create-item/). The metal and form factor are selected during the item creation process.

   data_light="/assets/images/light/create_item_bullion_selection_light.webp"
   data_dark="/assets/images/dark/create_item_bullion_selection_dark.webp"
   alt="Create item screen" %}

4) The input screen for registering a new bullion consists of:

* Name (Optional)
* Mint (Optional)
* Purity (aka fineness): it represents the karat as a ratio.
* Wear (Optional): percentage of loss due to circulation. It's commonly used for junk silver.
* Metal Content: weight exluding alloy in troy ounces or grams.

> Creating an item without selecting a bullion preset automatically creates a bullion using the item's attributes.

   data_dark="/assets/images/dark/create_bullion_dark.webp"
   alt="Create bullion screen" %}

5) Tap on "Save" to register the bullion.

6) Review your bullion presets.

Once you have saved a bullion, you can selected as a preset when you create a new item and review it from the "Catalog" tab.
