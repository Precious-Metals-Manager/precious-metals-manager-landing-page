You can modify or delete sales after they are created. To learn how to create a sale, refer to the [Create a Sale](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/help/create-sale/) guide.

1) Tap on an inventory item on the "Inventory" tab.

{% include theme-image.html
   data_light="/assets/images/light/inventory_with_item_light.webp"
   data_dark="/assets/images/dark/inventory_with_item_dark.webp"
   alt="Inventory screen" %}

2) On the inventory item page tap on one of the sales.

{% include theme-image.html
   data_light="/assets/images/light/inventory_item_sales_light.webp"
   data_dark="/assets/images/dark/inventory_item_sales_dark.webp"
   alt="Sale details screens" %}

3) Tap on "Edit" button on the top right for modifying a sale, or the "Delete Sale" button at the bottom of the page for deletion.

{% include theme-image.html
   data_light="/assets/images/light/edit_and_delete_sale_buttons_light.webp"
   data_dark="/assets/images/dark/edit_and_delete_sale_buttons_dark.webp"
   alt="Edit or delete sale buttons screen" %}

4) In case of modification, the input screen for updating an existing sale consists of:

* Recipient
* Quantity
* Unit price
* Shipping
* Sale date

{% include theme-image.html
   data_light="/assets/images/light/edit_sale_light.webp"
   data_dark="/assets/images/dark/edit_sale_dark.webp"
   alt="Edit sale screen" %}

5) Update the desired fields and save.
