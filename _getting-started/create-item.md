> An order is required before you can create an item. Follow the [Create an Order](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/help/create-order/) steps and come back if you haven't created an order yet.

The concept of "Item" in Precious Metals Manager represents a specific product, including name, physical details, year, quantity, unit price, tax, spot price, and note.

When you make a purchase at a coin shop or from another individual, you are buying items that form part of an order.

1) Tap on an order on the Orders tab.

   data_dark="/assets/images/dark/orders_one_order_dark.webp"
   alt="Tap on order" %}

2) Tap on "Add item" button on the top right.

   data_dark="/assets/images/dark/add_order_button_dark.webp"
   alt="Add item button" %}

> Alternatively, you can create an item from the list of orders by long-pressing on an order or from the list of order items screen.

3) The input screen for registering a new item consists of:

* Form Factor: Bar, Coin, Round
* Metal: "Gold", "Silver", "Platinum", "Palladium". When "Silver" is selected, a "Junk Silver" toggle is shown that allows you to choose from one of the "Junk Silver" presets.
* Coin (Optional): Select from one of the included presets, or create your own one.
* Name (Optional): only avaiable if a preset is not selected.
* Mint (Optional): only avaiable if a preset is not selected.
* Year (Optional)
* Quantity
* Metal Content: weight exluding alloy in troy ounces or grams.
* Purity (aka fineness): it represents the karat as a ratio.
* Wear (Optional): percentage of loss due to circulation. It's commonly used for junk silver.
* Unit price (Optional)
* Tax (Optional)
* Spot Price: the market price at the time of the purchase. By default it's using the order date. Tap on "On order date" for manual input.
* Note (Optional)

Once you have saved an item, you can review it from an "Order" or from the "Inventory" tab.
