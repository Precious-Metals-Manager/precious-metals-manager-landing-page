> An item is required before you can record a sale. Follow the [Create an Item](https://preciousmetalsmanager.com/help/create-item/) steps and come back if you haven't created an item yet.

The concept of "Sale" in Precious Metals Manager represents a transaction with a third-party organization or individual. In other words, a sale refers to a decrease in the stock of a particular item, whether for a profit, a loss, or as a gift.

1) Tap on an inventory item on the "Inventory" tab.

   data_light="/assets/images/light/inventory_with_item_light.webp"
   data_dark="/assets/images/dark/inventory_with_item_dark.webp"
   alt="Inventory screen" %}

2) On the inventory item page, purchases and sales are shown. Tap on one of the purchases to see the item details.

> Alternatively, you can see the item details by tapping on an order in the "Orders" tab, then tapping on "Items," and selecting a particular item.

> You can also create a sale by long-pressing an item on the order items page.
