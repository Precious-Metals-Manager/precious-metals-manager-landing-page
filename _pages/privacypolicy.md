## Information Collection and Use

Precious Metals Manager does not collect, store or share any personal information about you. 
No account creation is required.

Your content, e.g. orders, items, etc., is not saved on our servers nor do we have access to this data. 
Data entered into Precious Metals Manager resides only on your local device and, in case you are using 
the iCloud function of the application, synchronized with your personal iCloud CloudKit database (Apple service)

iCloud CloudKit syncs it between your devices automatically. You always have the option to disable iCloud 
from the system settings. The data is stored in an encrypted form on your device and cannot be read from 
or written to while the device is locked or booting. Some of the data is in an encrypted form in iCloud.

When fetching spot prices or offer prices for gold, silver, platinum or palladium a request is made to our servers to retrieve the spot or offer price(s).

The currency, which is based on your region, metals, metal content in ozt, product names and dates are sent to our servers only for retrieving data.

Precious Metals Manager uses your internet connection when fetching spot rates and syncing your data with iCloud.
